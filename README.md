# Python Self‑Assessment

Welcome! This mini‑project lets you check your Python fundamentals without needing an instructor to grade your work. Clone or download the repository, complete the function stubs in **src/student_functions.py**, then run the automated tests.

## How to use

1. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

3. Run the tests:

Head to the `Test Explorer` view in VSCode:

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/python/testing/test-explorer-no-tests.png">

You should see a list of tests you can run in batch or individually.

Run them all!

4. Iterate: Use the test feedback to debug and improve your solutions.

> Note If you open the folder in VS Code, the workspace automatically disables GitHub Copilot so that the assessment remains fully your own work.

## What you will practise

- Writing clean, idiomatic Python functions

- Working with numbers and sequences

- Using basic control flow and algorithms

- Running and interpreting automated tests
